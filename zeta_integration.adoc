1. Management Network. Alcor server configures the group table and the buckets in the group table for each computing node. 
Each group table corresponds to a Zeta Gateway Cluster (ZGC). Each bucket in the group table corresponds to a gateway in ZGC.

2. Gateway Network. The gateway node in ZGC is responsible for delivering the entries to the computing nodes when two VMs communicate for the first time.
